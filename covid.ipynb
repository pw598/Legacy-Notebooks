        "abstract: This tutorial shows how to build, fit, and criticize disease transmission models in Stan, and should be useful to researchers interested in modeling the COVID-19 outbreak and doing Bayesian inference. Bayesian modeling provides a principled way to quantify uncertainty and incorporate prior knowledge into the model. What is more, Stan's main inference engine, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling, is amiable to diagnostics, which means we can verify whether our inference is reliable. Stan is an expressive probabilistic programing language that abstracts the inference and allows users to focus on the modeling. The resulting code is readable and easily extensible, which makes the modeler's work more transparent and flexible. In this tutorial, we demonstrate with a simple Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model how to formulate, fit, and diagnose a compartmental model in Stan. We also introduce more advanced topics which can help practitioners fit sophisticated models; notably, how to use simulations to probe our model and our priors, and computational techniques to scale ODE-based models."

Indeed, transmission models of infectious diseases can help answer questions about forecasting and effects of interventions. Such models can be expressed in several ways^[The three broad categories are population-based, agent-based or stochastic models. Population-based models subdivide the total population into homogeneous groups (compartments) and model the volume of each group via a set of continuous-time differential equations or discrete-time difference equations. Individuals within each compartment are considered to have the same state with respect to the disease in question. Time-dependent number of individuals in each group is a solution of an ordinary differential equations (ODEs) system relating all the quantities.

Such models allow to account for heterogeneity in an explicit way but are very computationally demanding. Stochastic processes, such as Markov chains, are also used to describe transitions between compartments.]. Compartmental models described by ODEs have gained popularity due to several factors: they are relatively easy to formulate, require less computational time than agent-based models, and in the simplest case can be solved and/or analysed analytically. However in practice, the volumes of some compartments and most parameters driving the dynamic are latent, and thus need to be inferred.

We have already specified the priors $p(\\theta)$ and the likelihood $p(y|\\theta)$. Bayes rules tells us that the posterior distribution of the parameters $\\theta$ is $p(\\theta|y) \\propto p(\\theta)p(y|\\theta)$. We thus know this distribution $p(\\theta|y)$ up to a multiplicative constant. Stan provides a version of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which provides samples which approximativelly follow the $p(\\theta|y)$ distribution. By approximating the true posterior distribution by the empirical distribution on these samples, we can compute the expectations of functions of the paramaters, or e.g the probability that the number of infected student is more than 10 on the third day.],  -->\n",
